Examples include intelligent agents, which can perceive their environment and take actions to maximize their chances of success.\\n\\n3. **In Chemistry and Biology:** An agent can refer to a substance that brings about a chemical or biological effect. For example, a catalyst is a chemical agent that speeds up a chemical reaction, and a pathogen is a biological agent that causes disease.\\n\\n4. **In Social Sciences:** An agent can refer to an individual or entity that has the capacity to act intentionally and make choices. This is often discussed in the context of human agency.\\n\\n5. **In Literature and Media:** An agent can refer to a character who acts or exerts power or influence in a narrative, sometimes with a specific role like a secret agent or a double agent.\\n\\nEach of these definitions shares the common theme of an entity that acts to achieve a certain effect or outcome, but the specifics can vary widely depending on the field of study or context.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 287, 'prompt_tokens': 12, 'total_tokens': 299}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_319be4768e', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-ccbc6660-8aa0-4142-a299-c8ea6af25fcb-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 287, 'total_tokens': 299})"

      "An agent in this context refers to a system or entity powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that can perform tasks autonomously. It combines memory, planning, and reflection mechanisms to behave based on past experiences and to interact with other agents or its environment. These agents can execute complex tasks by decomposing them into smaller, manageable steps using techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.\n"
