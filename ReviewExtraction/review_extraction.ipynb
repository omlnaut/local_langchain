Here is the review: ```title: Für den Preis in Ordnung  text: Grundlegend gut, abe eigene Schraube notwendig.Positiv:Der Rankobelisk ist grundlegend leicht aufzubauen und kann nach eigenen Bedürfnissen auch etwas kürzer aufgestellt, indem ein Teil der Streben weggelassen wird.Er sieht gut aus und mit dem Grün passt er gut zu den Blättern einer Pflanze. Er scheint im ersten Moment stabil.Die Vorbohrungen waren gut und auch an der passenden Stelle zu finden, sodass das Zusammenbauen leicht war - bis auf einen negativen Punkt.Kritik: der Aufsatz, der die vier Seitenstränge oben zusammenhängt war in meinem Fall lackiert, sodass die Mutter nicht passte und sich verkeilte. Die Alternative kann daher eine eigene Schraube darstellen. Jetzt fehlt zwar der Aufsatz mit dem Kreis, was mich jedoch stört. Wer darauf nicht viel Wert legt, kann sich den Obelisken kaufen.  rating: 3,0 von 5 Sternen  ```'"
